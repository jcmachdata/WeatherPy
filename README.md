## Analysis

* As we can see from the Temperature v. Latitude plot, the temperature drops considerably the farther north from the equator that a city is located. However, temperatures were consistently warm (about 60-90 deg F) in the southern hemisphere and equatorial region. This is most likely due to the current season.
* There was no significant difference in cloud cover versus latitude, however there is an interesting trend involving the tendency of clouds to be present in specific percentages. They almost appear quanitized, like the energy levels of an atom.
* Going from the southern hemisphere to the equator, the average wind speed drops precipitously. It then picks up again in the northern hemisphere and actually increases slightly.
